Add multiple images per WooCommerce variation to enhance product visuals, build trust, and boost conversions with advanced galleries.

== Description ==

**[Variation Images](https://pluginever.com/plugins/wc-variation-images-pro/?utm_source=product-page-wordpress.org&utm_medium=product-page-wordpress.org&utm_campaign=product-page-wordpress.org)** lets you add **multiple images per variation** in your WooCommerce store. By default, WooCommerce only supports a single image for each product variation — forcing you to work around limited visuals. With this plugin, every variation can have its own image gallery.

Whether you are selling fashion, electronics, furniture, or digital goods, each product variation can now be shown from every angle. The variation image gallery supports zoom, lightbox, intuitive slider navigation, and is fully responsive across devices.

With support for image zoom, lightbox viewing, and flexible gallery positions, your store will look more professional and deliver an engaging shopping experience across all devices.

= With this plugin, you can: =

* Show realistic views and alternate angles per variation to build trust.
* Reduce customer hesitation by giving a full visual context before they select a variation.
* Make your product pages stand out and increase conversion rates.

= ✅ Key Benefits =

* Showcase complete product views with multiple images per variation
* Replace the default single image with a complete product variation image gallery
* Improve customer confidence with visual clarity and detailed variation views
* Help buyers make faster decisions with clear variation gallery visuals
* Enable advanced features like zoom, lightbox, and slider navigation
* Fully responsive and compatible with most WooCommerce themes

Whether you're looking to enhance your product pages or offer customers a better shopping journey, Variation Images helps your WooCommerce store stand out in a competitive market.
