Add multiple images per WooCommerce variation to enhance product visuals, build trust, and boost conversions with advanced galleries.

== Description ==

WC Variation Images is the ultimate solution to one of WooCommerce’s biggest limitations — it lets you add multiple images per variation on variable products, a feature missing in default WooCommerce.

By default, WooCommerce allows only a single image per product variation, which often leads to a poor visual experience. This limits your ability to showcase different colors, styles, or product views effectively. WC Variation Images fixes that by enabling you to create a fully-featured variation image gallery for each product variation.

Whether you're selling fashion, electronics, furniture, or digital goods, this plugin gives your customers a complete visual overview of the product they’re selecting. Adding additional variation image galleries improves trust, speeds up decision-making, and reduces cart abandonment.

With support for image zoom, lightbox viewing, and flexible gallery positions, your store will look more professional and deliver an engaging shopping experience across all devices.

= ✅ Key Benefits =

* Showcase multiple images per WooCommerce variation
* Replace the default single image with a complete product variation image gallery
* Improve customer confidence with visual clarity and detailed variation views
* Enable advanced features like zoom, lightbox, and slider navigation
* Fully responsive and compatible with most WooCommerce themes

Whether you're looking to enhance your product pages or offer customers a better shopping journey, WC Variation Images helps your WooCommerce store stand out in a competitive market.
